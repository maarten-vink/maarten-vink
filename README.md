# About this repository

In this github repository you can find code to replicate some (mainly descriptive) analyses of data on the global regulation of citizenship (eg from [GLOBALCIT](www.globalcit.eu)) as well on statistics of citizenship acquisition (eg from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat)). 

For replication code of [published research papers](https://scholar.google.pt), see my [dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/mpvink).
